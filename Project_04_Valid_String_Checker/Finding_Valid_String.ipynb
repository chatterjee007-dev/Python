If so, return \"YES\". Otherwise, check if removing just one character at any index in the string will make all characters appear the same number of times. If so, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n","## **Example :**\n","### **Input 1** = “abc”. This is a valid string because frequencies are {“a”: 1, “b”: 1, “c”: 1}\n","### **Output 1** - YES\n","### **Input 2** = “abcc”. This string is not valid as we can remove only 1 occurrence of “c”. That leaves character frequencies of { “a”: 1, “b”: 1 , “c”: 2 }\n","### **Output 2** – NO\n","---\n","## **Importing module 'Counter' :**\n","- ### As we need to count the frequency of each character, we will import the module 'Counter'.\n","- ### **Counter(string)** - It will count the frequency of each character in the input\n"," and create a dictionary where characters of input string will be keys and their frequency will be values.\n","---\n","- ### **set(count)** - will create set of all unique counts. So it checks how many values in 'count' are unique. If all the characters in our string appears same number of times - then the number of unique values will only be 1.\n","---\n","## **Below we will define 2 conditions using 'if' statement :**\n","- ### 1. If the number of unique values are all 1, then we will return \"YES\".\n","- ### 2.
